# Wizard Duel

## THIS GAME IS INCOMPLETE AS THE CARD EFFECTS ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED
## THE TEXT EFFECT CARDS OVERLAP BECAUSE THEIR LOGIC IS INCOMPLETE!

Turn based tabletop simulator with fancy animations. The game has text effect cards and spell effects cards and 
text effects modify the game and give interesting effects to the game and player itself.
Spell cards do damage, have an effect, and have fancy animations.
